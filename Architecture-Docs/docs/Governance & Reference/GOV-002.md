## **1. Purpose**

  

Define how changes move from code to production with controlled risk. Specify change types, gates, SLAs, canary policy, rollback, and incident linkage.

  

## **2. Scope**

  

All production impacting changes. Includes code, infra as code, schemas, data migrations, configuration, IAM, networks, secrets, observability, and CI and CD.

  

## **3. Change Types**

- Standard change. Pre-approved, low risk, fully automated, proven rollback. Example: rotating a stateless service within pinned versions.
    
- Normal change. Default path. Requires all readiness artefacts and gates.
    
- Emergency change. Sev1 only. Used to restore service or close an active breach. Follows Emergency path and post-change review.
    
- Freeze exception. Allowed only with signed waiver per GOV-001 section 8.
    

  

## **4. Environments and Promotion**

- Environments. Dev, Test, Preprod, Prod.
    
- Artifact immutability. Build once in CI, sign, and promote the same image or package.
    
- SBOM and attestations. Required on every artifact. Store with release record.
    
- Direct to Prod. Emergency only, with on-call SRE Lead and Security Lead present.
    

  

## **5. Planning and Windows**

- Cadence. Weekly planned release window, plus ad hoc windows as needed.
    
- Blackouts. Payments end of day, billing cycles, or announced events.
    
- Freeze. Year end or as declared by the Architecture Lead. Exceptions require waivers.
    

  

## **6. Readiness Criteria**

  

A Normal change cannot enter a window unless all are complete and linked in the ticket:

- ADR approved per GOV-001.
    
- STRIDE checklist and mitigations.
    
- IAM policy diff applied and reviewed.
    
- Data contract diff and migration plan with backout.
    
- SLOs and capacity check.
    
- Observability plan with dashboards and alerts.
    
- Canary plan and thresholds.
    
- Rollback plan and tested revert tag.
    
- Feature flag and kill switch registered.
    
- User docs and runbooks updated.
    

  

## **7. Feature Flags and Kill Switch**

- Every production change must expose a kill switch via a feature flag or config toggle.
    
- The toggle must be testable in Preprod and observable in Prod.
    
- Assign a named on-call owner for the flag.
    
- Document the exact rollback command or API and the expected time to revert.
    

  

## **8. Canary Policy and Baselines**

- Scope. Route 1 to 5 percent of traffic for 10 to 30 minutes, then 10 to 25 percent for 20 to 60 minutes before 100 percent. Services with small traffic use time based soak.
    
- Metrics. Error rate, latency, saturation, cost per request, and domain specific correctness.
    
- Baselines. Compare against the last 7 business days, business hours, p50 or tighter, excluding known incident periods.
    
- Thresholds. Fail canary if any key SLI exceeds baseline by more than: error rate +50 percent relative or +0.5 point absolute, p95 latency +20 percent, saturation +20 percent, or domain specific guardrails as defined in the SLO sheet.
    
- Automatic halt. Exceeding thresholds pauses the pipeline and pages on call.
    

  

## **9. Rollback and Backout SOP**

- Order of preference.
    
    1. Disable feature flag.
        
    2. Revert configuration.
        
    3. Roll back to last good artifact.
        
    4. Database backout using pre release snapshot and migration down script.
        
    
- Data safety. Pre release snapshot required for any write path or schema change.
    
- Targets. RTO and RPO per service must be met. Declare an incident if at risk.
    
- Evidence. Capture metrics before, during, after backout for postmortem.
    

  

## **10. Incident Linkage**

- If a change causes or correlates with a Sev1 or Sev2 condition, declare an incident, stop further releases, and enter Emergency process.
    
- Incident commander has authority to roll back without additional approvals.
    
- Link change ticket to incident record and attach graphs and logs.
    

  

## **11. Incident Severity Model and SLAs**

|**Severity**|**Definition**|**Examples**|**Duty officer**|**Acknowledge SLA**|**Mitigation SLA**|**Change policy**|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|Sev1|Critical customer impact or security breach|Region outage, data exfiltration, payment failure|SRE Lead|15 minutes|4 hours|Emergency change allowed|
|Sev2|Major degradation, no breach|10 percent users impacted, persistent 5xx spike|SRE Lead|30 minutes|1 business day|Normal path blocked until mitigated|
|Sev3|Minor impact|Single service partial issues|Tech Lead|4 hours|2 business days|Normal path continues with caution|
|Sev4|Cosmetic or non prod|Docs, CI, Dev only|Tech Lead|1 business day|1 sprint|No impact on release queue|

## **12. Normal Release Workflow**

1. Merge to main after checks pass.
    
2. CI builds, scans, signs, and publishes artifact and SBOM.
    
3. Create release ticket with links to all readiness artefacts.
    
4. CAB review and schedule window.
    
5. Pre checks. Freeze and blackout conflicts, on-call coverage, rollback tag, feature flag.
    
6. Deploy to Preprod. Run smoke, contract, and canary tests.
    
7. Deploy to Prod canary. Monitor against baselines and thresholds.
    
8. Increase traffic per policy.
    
9. Confirm success and close change.
    
10. Post release review within two business days.
    

  

## **13. Emergency Change Workflow**

1. Incident declared Sev1.
    
2. Emergency bridge with SRE Lead, Security Lead, Architecture Lead, Tech Lead.
    
3. Choose the fastest safe recovery: flag disable, config revert, artifact rollback, hotfix build.
    
4. Execute with live monitoring.
    
5. Stabilize, then freeze related releases.
    
6. Within two business days, hold a post change review, raise or update the ADR, and complete a retro of risks and controls.
    

  

## **14. Security Requirements**

- No production deploy without successful vulnerability scanning of artifact and dependencies, and policy gate approval.
    
- All IAM changes must ship with a least privilege diff and automated validation tests.
    
- Secrets use KMS and rotation playbooks per SEC documents. No inline secrets in CI or IaC.
    
- Code signing keys are stored in HSM or KMS with access logs.
    

  

## **15. Data and Schema Changes**

- Contract first. Update event and API contracts and publish to the registry.
    
- Backward compatibility. Support prior version during transition.
    
- Migrations. Include up and down scripts, pre release snapshot, and dry run in Preprod.
    
- Data lifecycle. Update retention and lineage maps.
    

  

## **16. Observability and Evidence**

- Required dashboards: availability, latency, errors, saturation, and domain correctness.
    
- Alerts tuned to SLOs.
    
- Store canary and rollout graphs with the ticket.
    
- Keep logs, metrics, traces, and deployment metadata for 24 months.
    

  

## **17. Records and Retention**

- Keep release notes, SBOMs, signatures, approvals, incident links, and artefact hashes for 24 months minimum.
    
- Tickets must be searchable by ADR ID, service, and date.
    

  

## **18. RACI for Releases**

## **20. Quality Gates in CI and CD**

- CI must block on failing unit, integration, contract, and security scans.
    
- CD must block on missing artefacts, missing approvals, failing canary, or missing on call coverage.
    
- All blocks produce actionable messages and links.
    

  

## **21. Compliance**

- Align with GOV-001 gates.
    
- Glossary in REF-001 must include Sev1 to Sev4, MTTD, MTTR, RPO, RTO, and DORA.
    
- Evidence must be exportable for audit within five business days.
