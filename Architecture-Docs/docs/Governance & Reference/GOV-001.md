Status: Approved

Owner: Architecture Lead

Approvers: Architecture Board

Last updated: 2025-10-28

Applies to: Neurocipher Pipeline, AuditHound, Agent Forge

Supersedes: none

Related: GOV-002 Change Control and Release Governance, REF-001 Glossary and Standards, ADR-011 System Boundary and Orchestrator Placement (Approved 2025-11-06)

  

## **1. Purpose**

  

Define how architectural decisions are proposed, evaluated, approved, recorded, and enforced across all systems in scope. Provide clear roles, gates, artefacts, and escalation paths.

  

## **2. Scope**

  

Covers software and infrastructure that materially affects reliability, security, data, cost, or user experience. Includes services, data stores, schemas, APIs, CI and CD, infra as code, observability, and runtime configuration.

  

## **3. Governance Structure**

  

### **3.1 Bodies**

- Architecture Board. Decision authority for architectural change.
    
- Risk Council. Reviews risk across security, reliability, and data.
    
- Change Advisory. Coordinates releases and emergency changes.
    

  

### **3.2 Roles**

- Architecture Lead. Chairs the Board. Owns ADR process.
    
- Security Lead. Owns STRIDE, IAM policy, secrets process.
    
- Data Steward. Owns data contracts, lineage, retention.
    
- SRE Lead. Owns SLOs, capacity, rollback and runbooks.
    
- Product Owner. Owns scope, value, user impact.
    
- Tech Lead. Owns solution design and delivery.
    
- Program Manager. Owns schedules, minutes, and follow ups.
    

  

### **3.3 Quorum and Voting**

- Quorum. 60 percent of seated members, minimum one of Security, Data, SRE, and Architecture present.
    
- Voting. Simple majority of present members. Ties resolved by Architecture Lead.
    
- Veto. Security Lead may veto on unresolved Sev1 or Sev2 security risks. Architecture Lead may veto on systemic architectural risk. Veto recorded with action plan and expiry.
    

  

### **3.4 Conflict of Interest and Recusal**

- Members must declare conflicts where personal or organizational incentives could bias a decision.
    
- Recusal is mandatory in such cases. Quorum recalculates without the recused member.
    
- Minutes must record the recusal and remaining quorum.
    

  

## **4. Decision Records**

- All material changes require an ADR. Use ADR template at /docs/governance/templates/adr.md.
    
- ADR states context, decision, options, consequences, risks, owner, affected artefacts, and rollback.
    
- Each ADR links to supporting checklists and analyses.
    

  

## **5. Lifecycle and Gates**

  

A change moves through gated reviews. Each gate requires specific artefacts.

  

### **5.1 Gates**

1. Proposal Gate
    
    - Artefacts. Problem statement, alternatives, high level diagram, draft cost, draft risk.
        
    - Exit. Board agrees the problem is valid and worth solving.
        
    
2. Design Gate
    
    - Artefacts. ADR v1, component diagrams, sequence, capacity assumptions, cost estimate, test approach.
        
    - Exit. Architecture fit approved.
        
    
3. Security Gate
    
    - Artefacts. STRIDE checklist, threat mitigations, IAM policy diff, secrets plan, dependencies risk.
        
    - Exit. No open Sev1 or Sev2 security issues.
        
    
4. Data Gate
    
    - Artefacts. Data contract diff, schema migration plan, PII map, retention and lifecycle, lineage impact.
        
    - Exit. Backward compatibility plan and migration verified.
        
    
5. Readiness Review
    
    - Artefacts. SLOs, canary and rollback plan, observability plan, runbooks, change window, owner on call.
        
    - Exit. Ready for release scheduling.
        
    
6. Pre release Gate
    
    - Artefacts. Release notes, change tickets, feature flags, kill switch registered, baselines set.
        
    - Exit. Go to production allowed.
        
    
7. Post release Review
    
    - Artefacts. Metrics deltas, incident notes, learning, follow ups, ADR finalization.
        
    - Exit. Close change or schedule fixes.
        
    

  

### **5.2 Required Artefact Locations**

- STRIDE checklist. /docs/security/templates/stride-checklist.md
    
- IAM diff template. /docs/security/templates/iam-diff.md
    
- Data contract change form. /docs/data/templates/contract-change.md
    
- SLO sheet. /docs/reliability/templates/slo.md
    
- Observability plan. /docs/observability/templates/plan.md
    
- Cost estimate worksheet. /docs/cost/templates/estimate.md
    
- Rollback plan. /docs/release/templates/rollback.md
    

  

## **6. Decision Classes and Risk Rubric**

- Architectural. Cross service impacts, language or framework choices, infra topologies.
    
- Security. Access models, trust boundaries, secret management, crypto.
    
- Data. Schemas, contracts, retention, residency, lineage.
    
- Reliability. SLOs, error budgets, capacity, failover.
    
- Cost and performance. Instance types, autoscaling, caching strategies.
    

  

Risk categories. user impact, compliance impact, blast radius, reversibility, time criticality.

  

## **7. Standards and Controls**

  

### **7.1 Feature Flags and Kill Switch**

- Every production change must include a feature flag that can disable the change without redeploy.
    
- A named on call owner is assigned before release.
    
- Rollback plan must specify the revert tag or commit and data restoration steps if needed.
    
- Flags and kill switches must be observable with clear dashboards and alerts.
    

  

### **7.2 Canary and Baselines**

- Canary metrics must compare against baselines from the last 7 business days, business hours, p50 unless otherwise stated.
    
- Exclude periods with known incidents from baselines.
    

  

### **7.3 Documentation**

- Update ADRs, runbooks, and user facing docs before the Pre release Gate.
    

  

## **8. Exception and Waiver Process**

- Waiver authority. Architecture Lead plus either Security Lead or Data Steward.
    
- Duration. Up to 30 days. One renewal maximum.
    
- Compensating controls. Must be documented and approved.
    
- Follow up. Retro ADR within 10 business days of waiver start.
    
- Logging. Waiver ID recorded in pull requests, tickets, and release notes.
    
- Scope. Waivers cannot bypass Sev1 or Sev2 security defects or legal compliance.
    

  

## **9. Meetings and Cadence**

- Architecture Board. Weekly, 60 minutes. Decision reviews and gate approvals.
    
- Design Clinics. Twice weekly, 45 minutes. Early feedback and risk surfacing.
    
- Risk Council. Monthly, first Monday, 45 minutes.
    
- Pre release Gate. Once per major release or as scheduled.
    
- Emergency Review. On demand, 15 minutes SLA to start.
    

  

Agendas and minutes templates at /docs/governance/templates/agenda.md and /docs/governance/templates/minutes.md.

  

## **10. Metrics and Reporting**

- Governance flow. Lead time from Proposal to Pre release, percent changes with complete artefacts at first submission, redo rate per gate.
    
- DORA. Lead time, deployment frequency, change fail rate, mean time to restore.
    
- Reliability. SLO attainment, error budget burn rate.
    
- Security. Open risks by severity, time to remediate.
    
- Data. Contract violation counts, migration success rate.
    

  

Monthly report to executives with trend charts and action items.

  

## **11. Records and Audit**

- Store ADRs under /docs/adr/ADR-xxxxx.md. Immutable after finalization except for status and links.
    
- Store gate checklists with change tickets. Keep for 24 months minimum.
    
- Minutes and decisions are searchable by ADR ID and change ticket.
    

  

## **12. Compliance and References**

- Use REF-001 for glossary and naming standards. Ensure Sev1 to Sev4, MTTD, MTTR, RPO, RTO, and DORA entries exist and match.
    
- Follow GOV-002 for release orchestration, incident SLAs, and emergency change rules.
