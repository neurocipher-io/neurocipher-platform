  

ADR-005 Observability and Telemetry

  

  

- Status: Accepted
- Date: 2025-10-23
- Owners: Platform SRE

  

  

  

Context

  

  

The data pipeline handles high-volume asynchronous workloads. Visibility is required for debugging, SLA enforcement, and anomaly detection.

  

  

Decision

  

  

Adopt full structured telemetry on AWS native stack.

  

- Logs: JSON structured, emitted via stdout, shipped to CloudWatch Logs.
- Metrics: CloudWatch custom metrics + embedded X-Ray segments.
- Tracing: AWS X-Ray tracing across Lambdas and Fargate.
- Dashboards: Grafana (managed) sourced from CloudWatch and Weaviate health endpoints.
- Alerts: CloudWatch Alarms → SNS → PagerDuty or Slack.

  

  

  

Alternatives

  

  

1. OpenTelemetry collector on ECS only.
2. Elastic APM.
3. Third-party observability SaaS.

  

  

Rejected for cost or management overhead.

  

  

Consequences

  

  

- Unified view of ingest rate, queue depth, embedding latency.
- Added telemetry cost proportional to event volume.
- X-Ray trace IDs embedded in logs.
