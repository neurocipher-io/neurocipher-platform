  

ADR-001 Architecture Baseline

  

  

- Status: Accepted
- Date: 2025-10-23
- Owners: Platform Lead

  

  

  

Context

  

  

Neurocipher requires an AWS-native data pipeline with strict separation from Nexis. Workloads include bursty ingestion, schema normalization, embedding, hybrid retrieval, and API access.

  

  

Decision

  

  

Adopt AWS-managed services for control plane and elasticity. Persist vectors in Weaviate. Keep hard separation from Nexis with no shared SDKs or schemas.

  

- Compute: Lambda for event handlers, Fargate for long-running workers
- Orchestration: EventBridge, SQS, Step Functions
- Storage: S3 raw and normalized, DynamoDB metadata
- Search: Weaviate for vector, OpenSearch Serverless for keyword
- Networking: VPC with private subnets and VPC endpoints
- Secrets and keys: Secrets Manager and KMS per environment

  

  

  

Alternatives

  

  

1. GCP or Azure native
2. Self-managed Kubernetes on EC2
3. Single engine for both vector and keyword

  

  

Rejected due to migration cost, ops overhead, or weaker query quality.

  

  

Consequences

  

  

- Fast path to production with managed primitives
- Vendor lock to AWS and Weaviate
- Separate budgets and accounts for dev, stg, prod
- No code sharing with Nexis
