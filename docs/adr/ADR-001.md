ADR-001 Architecture Baseline

  

  

- Status: Accepted
- Date: 2025-10-23
- Owners: Platform Lead

  

  

  

Context

  

  

Neurocipher requires an AWS-native data pipeline with strict separation from legacy upstream platforms. Workloads include bursty ingestion, schema normalization, embedding, hybrid retrieval, and API access.

  

  

Decision

  

  

Adopt AWS-managed services for control plane and elasticity. Persist vectors in Weaviate. Maintain hard separation from legacy platforms with no shared SDKs or schemas.

  

- Compute: Lambda for event handlers, Fargate for long-running workers
- Orchestration: EventBridge, SQS, Step Functions
- Storage: S3 raw and normalized, DynamoDB metadata
- Search: Weaviate for vector, OpenSearch Serverless for keyword
- Networking: VPC with private subnets and VPC endpoints
- Secrets and keys: Secrets Manager and KMS per environment

  

  

  

Alternatives

  

  

1. GCP or Azure native
2. Self-managed Kubernetes on EC2
3. Single engine for both vector and keyword

  

  

Rejected due to migration cost, ops overhead, or weaker query quality.

  

  

Consequences

  

  

- Fast path to production with managed primitives
- Vendor lock to AWS and Weaviate
- Separate budgets and accounts for dev, stg, prod
- No code sharing with external legacy stacks

## Acceptance Criteria

- Core control plane and data plane components are deployed in AWS accounts as defined in this ADR (VPC, subnets, S3 buckets, SQS, Lambda/ECS, Weaviate, OpenSearch Serverless).
- IaC modules under `iac/` implement this baseline architecture and pass CI validation for all environments (dev, stg, prod).
- `docs/architecture.md` and `docs/System-Architecture-Blueprint.md` align with the decisions recorded here (no conflicting alternate baselines).
- Downstream specs that depend on this baseline (ING-001–003, DM-003, LAK-001, SVC-001/002, OBS-001–003, REL-001/002) reference ADR-001 as the canonical architecture decision.
- Any deviation from this baseline in production is documented via a new ADR (superseding or exception) and cross-referenced from ADR-001.
